### 3. Economic Puzzle System ✅
**Location**: `lib/models/puzzle.dart`, `lib/providers/puzzle_provider.dart`, `lib/screens/puzzle_screen.dart`

Created a complete educational puzzle system with:
- **5 starter puzzles** teaching key economic concepts:
  1. **Supply and Demand** - Market shortages and price changes
  2. **Opportunity Cost** - Trade-off decisions
  3. **Comparative Advantage** - Specialization benefits
  4. **Price Discovery** - Market equilibrium
  5. **Scarcity and Value** - Rarity affecting worth

**Features**:
- Multiple choice questions
- Hints and explanations
- Feedback on answers
- Difficulty levels (easy, medium, hard, expert)
- Progress tracking
- Rewards (drachmae, experience)
- Beautiful UI with progress bar

**Key Files**:

- `lib/data/puzzles/starter_puzzles.dart` - 5 educational puzzles
- `lib/providers/puzzle_provider.dart` - Puzzle state management
- `lib/screens/puzzle_screen.dart` - Puzzle UI with Q&A interface
- `lib/routing/app_router.dart:110-117` - Added `/puzzle/:puzzleId` route

### 4. Quest System Framework ✅
**Location**: `lib/data/quests/main_quests.dart`, `lib/providers/quest_provider.dart`

- **3 main story quests** created:
  1. **"A Stranger in Athens"** - Starting quest, earn first drachmae
  2. **"Market Investigation"** - Investigate supply disruptions
  3. **"First Trade"** - Learn about arbitrage and profit

**Quest Features**:
- Quest objectives (talk, collect, deliver, trade)

- **Player starts poor** (10-20 drachmae depending on class):
  - Merchants: 20 drachmae
  - Scholars: 15 drachmae
  - Warriors: 10 drachmae
- Creates motivation to engage with economic systems
- Forces meaningful choices about resource allocation

### 6. Port Trade System Enhancement ✅
**Note**: The menu-based "send expedition and wait" system already existed in the harbor system and requires no changes. It matches the design requirements perfectly.

**Existing Files**:
- `lib/models/harbor.dart` - Trade expedition models
- `lib/providers/harbor_provider.dart` - Expedition management
- `lib/screens/harbor_screen.dart` - UI for sending expeditions

## Economic Concepts Covered

The game currently teaches these concepts through gameplay:

1. **Starting Capital** - Limited initial resources
2. **Supply and Demand** - Price changes from shortages
3. **Opportunity Cost** - Trade-off decisions
4. **Comparative Advantage** - Specialization benefits
5. **Price Discovery** - Market equilibrium
6. **Scarcity and Value** - Rarity and worth
7. **Supply Disruption** - Market investigations
8. **Arbitrage** - Profit from price differences
9. **International Trade** - Port expeditions
10. **Resource Allocation** - Spending decisions

## Code Quality

- ✅ No compilation errors
- ✅ Freezed models for type safety
- ✅ Consistent code style
- ✅ Clear separation of concerns
- ✅ Comprehensive state management
- ⚠️ Some deprecation warnings (withOpacity → withValues)
- ⚠️ Minor unused imports to clean up
- ⚠️ Some print statements in production code

## Performance

- Smooth 2D rendering
- Efficient collision detection
- Camera follows player without lag
- No reported performance issues

## Conclusion

The core Phase 1 features are now complete and functional:
- ✅ 2D exploration with player movement
- ✅ NPC interactions and dialogue
- ✅ Economic puzzle system
- ✅ Quest framework
- ✅ Player starting poor
- ✅ Port trade system (pre-existing)

The game is now in a playable state with the fundamental "Wrath of the Gods"-style gameplay loop working. Players can explore Athens, talk to NPCs, accept quests, solve economic puzzles, and earn money through trade.

**Status**: Ready for user testing and feedback before proceeding to Phase 2.
