A new Flutter project.

Game Design Document: "Odyssey of Olympus: Economic Myths"
Overview
Game Title: Odyssey of Olympus: Economic Myths
Platform: Flutter App (Mobile - iOS/Android)
Genre: Adventure/Educational Simulation
Target Audience: Ages 12+, students learning economics, history enthusiasts, casual gamers interested in mythology.
Core Concept: A blend of point-and-click adventure (inspired by Wrath of the Gods) and survival/resource management journey (inspired by Oregon Trail). Players embark on an epic quest across ancient Greece as a young hero, managing resources, making economic decisions, solving mythology-themed puzzles, and completing side quests. The game educates on fundamental economics concepts like supply/demand, trade, scarcity, opportunity cost, and market structures through interactive scenarios tied to Greek myths.
Objective: Guide your hero from Athens to Mount Olympus to petition Zeus for a boon (e.g., saving your village from economic ruin caused by a mythical curse). Along the way, navigate challenges that teach economics while surviving perils like mythical beasts and natural disasters.
Estimated Playtime: 4-6 hours for main story, plus replayability via branching paths and multiple endings.
Monetization: Free to play with optional in-app purchases for cosmetic items (e.g., mythical outfits) or hints. No paywalls for educational content.
Art Style: 2D hand-drawn illustrations with a vibrant, classical Greek aesthetic – think pottery art meets modern cartoon vibrancy. UI elements styled like ancient scrolls and marble tablets.
Sound Design: Ambient Greek lyre music, mythical sound effects (e.g., thunder for Zeus), voice-over narrations for key dialogues.
Story and Setting
Backstory: In a mythical version of ancient Greece, the gods have cursed the land with economic woes: droughts causing scarcity, monopolies controlled by titans, and unbalanced trade routes plagued by monsters. You play as Alexios (male) or Elara (female, player choice), a resourceful villager from a struggling polis (city-state). A prophecy reveals that only by journeying to Mount Olympus and proving your economic wisdom can you lift the curse and restore prosperity. Along the way, gods like Athena (wisdom in trade), Hermes (commerce and thievery), and Poseidon (resource management at sea) appear as mentors or challengers.
Narrative Structure:

Linear with Branches: Main path from Athens to Olympus, divided into 5-7 regions (e.g., Athens, Sparta, Delphi). Branching side paths for optional quests.
Multiple Endings: Based on economic decisions – e.g., a "Prosperous Empire" ending if you master trade, or "Fallen Hero" if you succumb to greed/scarcity.
Mythology Integration: Encounters with figures like Odysseus (teaching opportunity cost in choices), Sisyphus (endless labor as inefficiency), or the Minotaur (guarding a monopoly on resources). Puzzles reference myths, e.g., solving the Riddle of the Sphinx to access a market.

Gameplay Mechanics
Core Loop:

Travel and Map Navigation: Open-world map of ancient Greece. Players tap to move between locations (e.g., cities, temples, wilderness). Travel consumes resources (food, drachmae – ancient currency), with random events like storms or bandit attacks.
Resource Management (Oregon Trail Influence): Track inventory: Food, Water, Drachmae, Tools, Trade Goods. Scarcity forces decisions – e.g., hunt for food (mini-game) or trade at markets. Health/Energy bar depletes from poor choices, leading to game over if zeroed.
Interactions and Puzzles (Wrath of the Gods Influence): Point-and-click to interact with NPCs, objects, or environments. Solve riddles, answer economics quizzes disguised as mythical dialogues, or complete mini-games.
Side Quests and Mini-Games: Optional activities like hunting (archery tap-mini-game), trading caravans, or farming simulations to earn resources.
Progression System: Level up "Economic Wisdom" skills (e.g., Bargaining, Forecasting) through successful decisions, unlocking new abilities like better trade deals or puzzle hints.

Key Mechanics in Detail:

Travel System: Map divided into hex tiles or nodes. Each move costs time/resources. Random events: "A harpy steals your goods – pay tribute (opportunity cost) or fight (risk/reward)."
Inventory and Economy: Limited slots to teach scarcity. Buy/sell at dynamic markets where prices fluctuate based on supply/demand (e.g., drought raises food prices).
Combat/Conflicts: Non-violent, puzzle-based. E.g., "Debate" a merchant (riddle on monopolies) or "Outwit" a beast (economics quiz on resource allocation).
Mini-Games:

Hunting: Timed tapping to shoot arrows at animals (teaches supply – overhunt and animals become scarce).
Trading: Haggling mini-game where you negotiate prices, learning bargaining and market equilibrium.
Farming: Plant/harvest crops in a simple sim, demonstrating production costs and returns.


Educational Integration: Every major decision pops up a "Mythical Lesson" tooltip explaining the concept (e.g., "By choosing to trade grain for tools, you've embraced comparative advantage – like how Athena trades wisdom for loyalty."). Optional deep-dive modes for more info.
Difficulty Modes: Easy (hints galore, infinite resources), Normal (balanced), Hard (realistic scarcity, permadeath).

Locations and World Map
Map Layout: Stylized top-down view of Greece, with fast-travel unlocked via quests. Key locations:

Athens (Starting Hub): Bustling marketplace. Learn basics: Buy/sell tutorial, interact with philosophers teaching supply/demand. Side quest: Help a vendor break a monopoly.
Sparta (Military Outpost): Focus on opportunity cost (train warriors vs. farm). Puzzle: Allocate resources in a war council. Mini-game: Spartan training (endurance tap-game).
Delphi (Oracle Temple): Riddles and prophecies. Economics quiz with the Oracle on forecasting markets. Myth: Consult Apollo for "divine" economic advice.
Thebes (Labyrinth City): Maze puzzle inspired by Minotaur myth. Teach market structures (e.g., navigate "monopoly corridors"). Side quest: Hunt mythical beasts for rare goods.
Corinth (Trade Port): Sea voyage mini-segment. Manage ship resources (Oregon Trail-style), trade with islands. Lesson: International trade and tariffs (Poseidon's "tides" as barriers).
Mount Olympus (Endgame): Final trials with gods. Boss puzzles: Debate Zeus on wealth distribution, outsmart Hades on scarcity in the underworld.
Wilderness Areas: Forests, mountains, seas for random encounters and resource gathering.

Quests and Educational Elements
Main Quest Line:

Prologue: The Curse Awakens – Gather starting resources in Athens, learn scarcity from a famine event.
Journey to Sparta – Manage travel supplies, face opportunity cost in side paths (help a farmer or raid a temple?).
Oracle's Wisdom – Solve riddles on demand curves.
Labyrinth of Wealth – Navigate puzzles teaching oligopolies and competition.
Seas of Commerce – Trade quests with Hermes, learn comparative advantage.
Ascent to Olympus – Culminating decisions on economic policies for your village.

Side Quests (10+ Total):

Hunt the Nemean Lion: Mini-game hunting, teaches sustainable resource use (overhunting leads to extinction/scarcity).
Trade with the Cyclops: Bargain for tools, demonstrating negotiation and value.
Aid the Muses: Creative puzzle where you "produce" art, learning about labor markets and incentives.
Escape Cerberus' Monopoly: Break a mythical monopoly on underworld goods, quiz on antitrust concepts.

Economics Concepts Covered:

Scarcity and Choice: Limited resources force prioritization.
Supply and Demand: Dynamic markets with price changes.
Opportunity Cost: Every decision has trade-offs (e.g., spend time hunting vs. trading).
Trade and Comparative Advantage: Specialize and exchange for mutual benefit.
Market Structures: Monopolies (titans controlling resources), competition (open markets).
Incentives and Externalities: Rewards for good decisions, penalties for pollution/overuse (e.g., angering gods causes disasters).
Macroeconomics Basics: Inflation from too much currency, growth through investment.
Each concept tied to a myth for memorability (e.g., Midas' touch for greed/inflation).
